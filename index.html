    <h3>Francis Kwame Nkrumah's Life Story</h3>
    <p>
        Kwame Nkrumah was born on 21 September 1909,in Nkroful, Gold Coast (now Ghana).Nkroful was a small village in the Nzema area,in the southwest of the Gold Coast, close to the frontier with the French colony of the Ivory Coast. His father did not live with the family, but worked in Half Assini where he pursued his goldsmith business until his death. Kwame Nkrumah was raised by his mother and his extended family, who lived together traditionally, with more distant relatives often visiting. He lived a carefree childhood, spent in the village, in the bush, and on the nearby sea.During his years as a student in the United States, he was known as Francis Nwia Kofi Nkrumah, Kofi being the name given to males born on Fridays.He later changed his name to Kwame Nkrumah in 1945 in the UK, preferring the name "Kwame".According to Ebenezer Obiri Addo in his study of the future president, the name "Nkrumah", a name traditionally given to a ninth child, indicates that Kwame probably held that place in the house of his father, who had several wives.
